\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
%Write about the conclusion of your work and what you plan for the next semester.
So far we have defined and motivated the problem of solving fMOOP with restrictions on condition number and showed how it generalizes different problems of interests. We also summarized different methods to solve MOOPs and some important results on condition number of matrices and that of function. We also saw how we can simplify and bound the condition number of a function which is a composition of other simpler functions and its potential application applied to neural networks.
\newline \newline In Future works I'm planning to answer few of the the questions mentioned in the analysis chapter \ref{important_questions} after prioritizing them based on available time and difficulty of the question. Later I'm planning to implement few of the methods and compare their results for this problem.
