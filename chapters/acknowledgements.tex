For their extraordinary guidance and assistance, without which this research would not have been feasible, I would like to extend my appreciation to my guide and faculty supervisor, \textbf{Dr. Geetanjali Panda}. She has always encouraged me to do as much research as I can, read as many papers as I can, and test out as many concepts as I can. Whatever challenges I had while working on the project, she was always there to support me.\\

Finally, I want to thank the Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur for giving me the chance to complete the work I have done and my family and friends for their emotional support throughout this pandemic.
