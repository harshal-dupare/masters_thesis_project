I would like to express my gratitude towards my guides and faculty supervisors, \textbf{Dr. Swanand Ravindra Khare} and \textbf{Dr. Geetanjali Panda} for their exceptional guidance and support, without which  this project would not have been possible. They have always motivated me to explore as much as I can, look into multiple papers and try as many ideas as I can. They have always supported me through whatever problems I faced during the project.\\

Finally I would like to thank my family and friends for morally supporting me during this pandemic and the Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur for providing me opportunity to carry out the work that I have done.
