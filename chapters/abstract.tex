\paragraph{} This thesis studies the methodologies to solve Functional Multi-Objective Optimizations Problems (fMOOP) in which we are looking for functions as solutions of Multi-Objective Optimization Problems, where one of the objective/constraint is to minimize/bound the condition number of such a solution function found. First we will see why such problems are important. Then we will survey the different methodologies for solving MOOP in general and then summarize few results on condition number of matrices and of function. Then We will analyze different methods in regards to their potential to be used for finding well condition solutions of fMOOP.  Based on the analysis we will Select few methods and compare them with experimental results.

% \paragraph{} Growing Hate-content on online platforms is a serious problem and has given rise to numerous  discussions about the need for regulation and monitoring of posted content. However using stringent measures such as account suspension or removal of the post somehow is a threat to the doctrine of free speech.   

% \paragraph{} Researchers worldwide have found that counter -narratives can effectively neutralize hate speech and incite constructive dialogue. The focus is to directly intervene in the conversation with textual responses that counter the hate content and prevent it from further spreading. The aim of this research is to analyse the quality of counter-narrations in combating against online hate speech using automated generation-techniques like pre-trained Language Models. We conduct experiments on a diverse corpus of online speech and the responses they generate and evaluate the effect and quality of a novel approach on the dialogue.
