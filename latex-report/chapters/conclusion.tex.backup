\chapter{Conclusion}
Our target is to achieve a better congestion control algorithm for small buffered high speed network. Here we have two (EV-TCP and EV2-TCP) modified mechanism which give better result for small buffered high speed network. During design of this mechanism, our target was to achieve better Good-Put, instead of better link utilization, because only good-put is visible to application. So, if we can increase good-put, applications which are using our protocol will perform better.

\paragraph{} From above experiments, we found that, EV2-TCP is better with respect to good-put, response, and fairness. EV2-TCP also provides lower utilization than EV-TCP and E-TCP. Good-put of EV2-TCP is nearly equivalent to utilization of bandwidth. It means that most of the packets arrived at EV2-TCP receiver is in-ordered. So, EV2-TCP receiver does not needs to maintain a large buffer to keep incoming out-of-order packets. But EV-TCP and E-TCP have larger utilization than good-put. So, a large number of packets received at receiver sides are out-of-order. These packets either have to be stored or discarded. If we want to store them, we require a large buffer. If we want to discard them, then good-put will drop as sender needs to resent them.

\paragraph{} After all, EV-TCP and EV2-TCP still have higher loss-rate than TCP-NewReno. So, in future we can try to bring down
